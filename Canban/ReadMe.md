## Everyone like to play games  
Our Canban make it possible to make a work more fun. Because all of us need to make our needed work but to make it more interesting to work more SuperUser can create tasks that won't be assigned to any user. These taska has money price which you get on top of your month salary.

![Optional Tasks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41269745/115908832-f3e08b80-a46a-11eb-8df2-4fe7cd25b9ad.png)

As you can see the user see that there are optional tasks and he can or she can take task with button on them.

## How to move Tasks?

When you have task assigned to you you can move them with the arrow on top of the task.  
![Task](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41269745/115909114-56d22280-a46b-11eb-969b-bab2e414d9fe.png)

Also there is a info button to see all information about this task.

And last button on this site is: I need help.  
When you click on it it makes this task vissible for other users so they can see that someone need help and they can help.

The task on the side of another user looks like this:  
![Task with need of help](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41269745/115909582-00b1af00-a46c-11eb-834a-08482ec1a5e5.png)

### We tried to make the layout as intuitive as possible to make it more user friendly.  

### Why is this better than another?

Because we tried to create it as a part of the bigger thing. That you could login on all sites with one login to our ecosystem.
